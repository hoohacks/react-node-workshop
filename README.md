# HooHacks 2021 - React & Node.js Workshop

React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library used to develop structured user interfaces for websites and web apps.  Node.js is a runtime environment used to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser.  If used together, React & Node.js can be used to build quick, easy, and scalable web and moblie apps.  

This GitHub Repository contains code for a basic search application which will be explained further during the React & Node.js workshop.


### Create Basic React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

1. Download IDE 
    1. Recommended: [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

2. Download [npm] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    1. There is no need to download Node.js seperately - it is included in this step.

3. After downloading repository, open terminal in the ```search_app\client-side``` folder.
    1. Run the command 
    ```bash
        npx create-react-app {insert project name}
    ```

## `npm run start`

This command runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

The page will update live as edits are made.
